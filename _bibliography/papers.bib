abstract = {We measure the fraction of galaxy–galaxy mergers in two clusters at z ∼ 2 using imaging and grism observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. The two galaxy cluster candidates were originally identified as overdensities of objects using deep mid-infrared imaging and observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and were subsequently followed up with HST/WFC3 imaging and grism observations. We identify galaxy–galaxy merger candidates using high-resolution imaging with the WFC3 in the F105W, F125W, and F160W bands. Coarse redshifts for the same objects are obtained with grism observations in G102 for the z ∼ 1.6 cluster (IRC0222A) and G141 for the z ∼ 2 cluster (IRC0222B). Using visual classifications as well as a variety of selection techniques, we measure merger fractions of 11 -3.2 +8.2 in IRC0222A and 18 -4.5 +7.8 in IRC0222B. In comparison, we measure a merger fraction of 5.0 -0.8 + 1.1 {\%} for field galaxies at z ∼ 2. Our study indicates that the galaxy–galaxy merger fraction in clusters at z ∼ 2 is enhanced compared to the field population, but note that more cluster measurements at this epoch are needed to confirm our findings},

abstract = {We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism observations for COBRA 1411+3415, originally identified as a high-redshift cluster candidate in the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey using radio, infrared, and optical data. We spectroscopically identify seven cluster members within a 0.5 Mpc radius with grism redshifts in the range 1.8006 ≤ zgrism ≤ 1.8175, consistent with COBRA 1411+3415 being a high-redshift cluster with a mean redshift of 〈zgrism〉 = 1.8106 ± 0.0006. The detection of seven galaxies within this small redshift range is significant above the background distribution of galaxies at the level of 5$\sigma$. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster is found to be $\sigma$∥ = km s−1 with a virial mass of M200 ≈ × 1014 M⊙. However, the mass may be lower if the cluster is still in formation. In projected phase space, we also identify two possible infalling members of COBRA 1411+3415 and two additional structures at z ∼ 1.73 and z ∼ 1.88. The similar spatial distributions and small projected separation from the main cluster suggest they could be a part of the same large-scale filament and together may form a protocluster system that could eventually merge to form a single, massive cluster. COBRA 1411+3415 is the highest-redshift cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed using a bent, double-lobed radio source as a cluster tracer.},

abstract = {We present $\backslash$chandra X-ray observations of the dynamically complex galaxy cluster Abell 119 ({\$}z = 0.044{\$}). A119 is host to two NAT radio sources (0053-015 $\backslash${\&} 0053-016) whose tails are oriented parallel to each other despite orthogonally oriented jet axes. Imaging and spectral analysis reveal X-ray emission elongated along the NE-SW axis along with the presence of complex structures, including surface brightness discontinuities, which suggest possible merger activity along this axis. From radial profiles of the X-ray surface brightness, temperature, pressure, and density, we identify two surface brightness edges which are found to be cold fronts, possibly associated with large-scale sloshing of ICM gas. We also identify a brightness edge to the south which is found to be a shock front with Mach number {\$}M = 1.21 \backslashpm 0.11{\$}, consistent with a merger shock. In addition, previous optical studies show alignment of optical substructures along the north-south direction. The elongated X-ray emission, orientations of the NAT tails, and alignment of optical substructure all suggest recent or on-going merger activity in the NE-SW direction.},
