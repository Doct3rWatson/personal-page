abstract = {We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism observations for COBRA 1411+3415, originally identified as a high-redshift cluster candidate in the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey using radio, infrared, and optical data. We spectroscopically identify seven cluster members within a 0.5 Mpc radius with grism redshifts in the range 1.8006 ≤ zgrism ≤ 1.8175, consistent with COBRA 1411+3415 being a high-redshift cluster with a mean redshift of 〈zgrism〉 = 1.8106 ± 0.0006. The detection of seven galaxies within this small redshift range is significant above the background distribution of galaxies at the level of 5$\sigma$. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster is found to be $\sigma$∥ = km s−1 with a virial mass of M200 ≈ × 1014 M⊙. However, the mass may be lower if the cluster is still in formation. In projected phase space, we also identify two possible infalling members of COBRA 1411+3415 and two additional structures at z ∼ 1.73 and z ∼ 1.88. The similar spatial distributions and small projected separation from the main cluster suggest they could be a part of the same large-scale filament and together may form a protocluster system that could eventually merge to form a single, massive cluster. COBRA 1411+3415 is the highest-redshift cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed using a bent, double-lobed radio source as a cluster tracer.},

abstract = {We present $\backslash$chandra X-ray observations of the dynamically complex galaxy cluster Abell 119 ({\$}z = 0.044{\$}). A119 is host to two NAT radio sources (0053-015 $\backslash${\&} 0053-016) whose tails are oriented parallel to each other despite orthogonally oriented jet axes. Imaging and spectral analysis reveal X-ray emission elongated along the NE-SW axis along with the presence of complex structures, including surface brightness discontinuities, which suggest possible merger activity along this axis. From radial profiles of the X-ray surface brightness, temperature, pressure, and density, we identify two surface brightness edges which are found to be cold fronts, possibly associated with large-scale sloshing of ICM gas. We also identify a brightness edge to the south which is found to be a shock front with Mach number {\$}M = 1.21 \backslashpm 0.11{\$}, consistent with a merger shock. In addition, previous optical studies show alignment of optical substructures along the north-south direction. The elongated X-ray emission, orientations of the NAT tails, and alignment of optical substructure all suggest recent or on-going merger activity in the NE-SW direction.},
