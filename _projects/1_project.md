I started this project because I wanted a certain smart calendar that was going viral online but without the price tag. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/meal.png" title="meal plan" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/todo.png" title="to-do list" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/weather.png" title="weather widget" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Includes editable meal planning and to-do list widgets and location-based weather widget
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/cal.png" title="full calendar" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
